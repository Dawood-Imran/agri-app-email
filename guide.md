## Expert:
- Add the consultation hours, add the area of specialization for the expert, which is in the form of a picker, which the expert can select from which area he specifies. Add these to NewExpert Screen.


 - And for the new expert, the pending consultation completed today and rating are 0. We have the number of consultations also 0 for the new expert and we store that particular data in the Firebase for the expert. And for the expert, add a table in the Firebase for the recent consultations, which contains the former, which has the message from there. And we show the recent consultations on the messages tab from the Firebase.
 
 ## Farmer
 
  For the farmer, on the help experts, we show the number of experts the user can consult from like we have shown in the ExpertConsultation screen. And if the former click on the chat, we show some messages, which the farmer can send to the expert. And we update the recent consultation table for the expert by the name of the farmer, the message and the time, which former has sent that particular message. And we show that particular message on the expert message tab from the Firebase.
  
  
  ## Every User

   For every user, add a field for the coin and also add the field for the preferred language, which language the user has chosen at the start of the sign-in. Also, make sure that every time the user sign-in, we show that particular language. Hope you understand the concept.
