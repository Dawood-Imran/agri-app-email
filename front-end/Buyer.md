## Buyer Dashboard Features

When a buyer signs in, they will be directed to the **Buyer Dashboard**. The dashboard consists of two main tabs: **Auction System** and **Account**.

---

### 1. **Auction System Tab**:
- **Description**: This tab is designed to display available crops for bidding. Buyers can participate in auctions to place bids on the crops they are interested in.
- **Current State**:
  - Initially, it will display available auction items once the system is implemented.

### 2. **Account Tab**:
- **Description**: The account tab is where the buyer can update their profile information, payment methods, and account settings.
- **Current State**:
  - **Message**: "Welcome to Account".
  - For now, this tab will simply display the welcome text until additional account features are implemented.

### Notes:
- Both tabs, **Auction System** and **Account**, will be **similar in structure** to the tabs created for the **Farmer's Menu** and **Account Tabs**.
  - **Auction System Tab**:
    - Styled to include a list of available auctions with cards or list items for each crop up for bidding.
  - **Account Tab**:
    - Consistent with the **Farmer's Account Tab**, using the same color themes and layout.
  
- **Styling**: The styling will follow the same design as used on other screens:
  - Consistent button design, rounded corners, and app color palette.
  - Maintain the same styling from the **Sign In** and **Sign Up** pages to ensure uniformity across the app.
