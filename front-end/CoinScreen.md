When different users (Farmers, Experts, Buyers) click on the coins displayed in the header, here's what will be shown for each type of user:

##For Farmers:
Current Coin Balance: Farmers will see their current Agro Coin balance at the top, along with a description of how the coins can be used (e.g., yield prediction, expert consultations, accessing premium features).
Buy More Coins: A prominent "Buy Coins" button will be available, allowing farmers to purchase more coins. This screen will show various purchasing options with prices, and upon selection, farmers can complete the transaction through available payment methods.
Transaction History: Below the balance and purchase options, there will be a list of past transactions, showing when coins were bought or spent (e.g., for consultation or other services), helping farmers track their coin usage.

## For Experts:
Earned Coins Balance: Experts will see the number of coins they have earned from consultations with farmers. The balance will update each time a farmer pays for the service.
Consultation History: A list showing consultation sessions with details like date, duration, and the number of coins earned from each session.
Withdraw Coins: Experts may see an option to withdraw their earned coins or convert them into local currency or other incentives, depending on how you plan to integrate the payment system.
## For Buyers:
Current Coin Balance: Buyers will also see their coin balance and options to buy coins if needed for purchasing crops in auctions or for other services in the app.
Buy Coins: A similar "Buy Coins" option will allow buyers to top up their balance. This can be useful if the buyer needs to place bids in the auction system.
Transaction History: Buyers can also view their transaction history, showing coin purchases and where they have spent coins, such as in auctions or buying crops directly.
This setup ensures that each user type gets a personalized experience, with relevant actions and information based on their role in the app.
